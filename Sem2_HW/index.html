                Personally, I've never considered myself a cat person. I had two dogs growing up - will always love them, even though they are not around anymore, sadly. 
            </p>
            <p>
                People are certainly onto something, when they say that dogs are 'Man's Best Friend'. 
            </p>
            <p>
                But, what about about those hot-tempered felines ?
            </p>
            <p>
                It's not that I ever dis-liked them, it turns out, I never made a proper cat friend before. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Until year 2019, when I met Lamar, who probably is the best kitty out there. 
            </p>
            <p class="features"> So, what makes Lamar so special ? </p>
            <ul>
                <li>He's handsome. Obviuosly</li>
                <li>He's also the cuddliest and chillest cat out there. Doesn't even know how to use his little claws</li> 
                <li>Mar's got the pinkiest little nose and jelly beans. And is nice enough to let you touch those, too</li>
                <li>He's so photogenic, you end up having hundreds of photps of him in no time </li>
            </ul>
